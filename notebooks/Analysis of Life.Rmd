## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, messages=FALSE}
d <-readr::read_csv(here("data/gapminder/raw/gapminder_data.csv"))
```

## Data
```{r}
pander(summary(d))
```

The data consist of `r length(unique(d$country))` unique countries tracked from `r range(d$year)[1]` to `r range(d$year)[2]`. Table 1 presents a summary of the variables
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
#d2 <- d %>%
# group_by(country) %>%
  
  
```

## Results

```{r results= "asis"}
m <- lm(lifeExp ~ continent + year + pop, data=d)

stargazer(m, type = "HTML")
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
