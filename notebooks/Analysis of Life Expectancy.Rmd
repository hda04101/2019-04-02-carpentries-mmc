## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, messages=FALSE}
d <-readr::read_csv(here("data/gapminder/raw/gapminder_data.csv"))
```

## Including Plots
# Make a plot of population

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
d %>% 
  filter(continent=="Asia") %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=pop,
                   group=country, color=country))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
